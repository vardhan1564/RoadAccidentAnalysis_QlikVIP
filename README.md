# Visualization :
                Preparing the data for visualization involves cleaning the data to remove irrelevant or
        missing data, transforming the data into a format that can be easily visualized, exploring
        the data to identify patterns and trends, filtering the data to focus on specific subsets of
        data, preparing the data for visualization software, and ensuring that the data is
        accurate and complete. This process helps to make data easily understandable and
        ready for creating visualizations to gain insights.

# Dashboards :
                A dashboard is a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays information and
        data in an organized and easy-to-read format. Dashboards are often used to provide
        real-time monitoring and analysis of data. They are typically designed for a specific
        purpose or use case. Dashboards can be used in a variety of settings, such as business,
        finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and many other industries. They can be used to
        track key performance indicators (KPIs), monitor performance metrics, and display data
        in the form of charts, graphs, and tables.
                A dashboard in Qlik refers to a collection of visualizations, data, and analytics
        designed to provide a comprehensive view of key metrics and insights. Qlik, a leading
        data analytics and business intelligence platform, allows users to create interactive
        dashboards that enable real-time data exploration and decision-making.

# StoryTelling : 
                Storytelling in a Qlik project involves crafting a narrative around the insights and
        findings derived from data analysis using Qlik Sense. It's about presenting data in a
        compelling and informative way that engages stakeholders and communicates key
        insights effectively.
                A data story is a way of presenting data and analysis in a narrative format, with
        the goal of making information more engaging and easier to understand. A data story
        typically includes a clear introduction that sets the stage and explains the context for
        the data, a body that presents the data and analysis in a logical and systematic way and
        a conclusion that summarizes the key findings and highlights their implications. Data
        stories can be told using a variety of media, such as reports, presentations, interactive
        visualizations and videos
